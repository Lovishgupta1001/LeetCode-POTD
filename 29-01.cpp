     * Basically we are using the concept of LRUCache in this LFUCache question but with a twist

     * We're creating separate Lists for each use-frequency of the Nodes,
     * and we're adding the nodes in those Lists following the LRU algorithm
     *
     * Everytime a key is being accessed (get/put), we're fetching the Node corresponding to that key
     * and the List corresponding to that Node, then we're deleting the Node from the LRU position of
     * the List, the Node is residing in and adding that same Node at the front (MRU position) of the List
     * having Nodes with use-frequency 1 greater than the use-frequency of the Node that was recently deleted.
     *
     * (list is mapped against use-frequency of the Nodes, means in a List all the nodes have
     * the same use-frequency and those Nodes are stored following the LRU mechanism)
